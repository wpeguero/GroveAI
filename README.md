# Grove AI

This is a project for developing a machine learning algorithm using The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) data sets that will
1. Classify the image as either benign or malignant
2. Create an ROI around the possible location of the tumor
3. determine the stage of the tumor.

GroveAI is the culmination of functions used to extract the data and develop the machine learning models. The goal is to develop algorithms that can be used for extracting, analyzing and formatting both images and metadata to feed into Artificial Neural Networks.
