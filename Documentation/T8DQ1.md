# Topic 8 Discussion Question 1

As you are preparing for graduation, reflect on the possibility of publishing or presenting your current and future work. One first step toward this goal is to identify venues for publishing and presenting. Do the following:

1. Peruse opportunities on call-for-papers websites like the "Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Publications - Calls for Papers," located in the topic resources.
2. Identify three possible journals and three possible conferences for which it would be appropriate for you to submit a proposal. For each journal, briefly state in 1-2 sentences why your capstone project would be a good fit. Identify the specific areas and sessions as listed on the journal/conference website.
3. For one of the journals or conferences identified above, prepare a complete proposal and abstract, following the guidelines on the website, that you could submit if you decided to.
4. In yourr response to this DQ,  include the proposal (typically, answers to a few questions) and abstract (typically about 300-500 words). You do not have to submit the proposal to the journal/conference.

Comment on two other posts in class and provide feedback on the content, format, and adequacy of their would be submissions.

## Response

1st paper: [PLOS ONE - Early Detection, Screening, and Diagnosis of Cancer](https://collections.plos.org/call-for-papers/early-detection-screening-and-diagnosis-of-cancer/)

- My capstone project is focused on the early diagnosis of cancer, which fits the overall theme of the call-for-papers. My capstone project also uses collected medical data to assist in the developement of a machine learning model that can diagnose cancer using an image.

2nd paper: [The Lancet](https://www.thelancet.com/lancet/about?dgcid=hubspot_landing-page_lancetgrouponcology22&hsCtaTracking=fcaee0aa-219e-4b22-af31-eb0c6fa894c7%7C91978063-5c1a-406c-96a6-2d785a928cd9)

- The Lancet focuses on publishing cancer-related content, which matches the theme of my capstone project. The focus of the Lancet Journal is to publish academic articles that improve clinical practices (my capstone project currently aims to improve the field of radiology by lessening the workload of radiologists) and bring to attention the need for improved cancer health services.

3rd paper: [Biomedcentral](https://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/aicancerdiagnosis)

- This journal focuses on exploring new and innovative technologies in relation to cancer which my capstone project focuses on. The capstone project aims to demonstrate that current AI algorithms can be used to lighten the workload of radiologists.

1st conference: [Mind the Gap: Trailblazing Cancer Prevention](https://www.eacr.org/conference/cancerprevention2023?utm_source=hub&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=vMTG23)

- This conference aims to focus on preventative care of cancer. Part of cancer prevention is early diagnosis, which my capstone project focuses upon as it aims to assist radiologists at detecting malignant tumors in the earlier stages of cancer.

2nd conference: [AICR Research Conference](https://www.aicr.org/research/aicr-research-conference/)

3rd conference: [Cancer Research Conference](https://cancerresearchconference.org/)

## Abstract

Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States. Although healthy choices, such as eating healthier or not smoking, reduces the risk of getting cancer, the last and ultimate line of defense for those who may be afflicted from cancer is early tumor detection. Cancer afflicts those who even live a healthy, as cancer can be genetic in nature. Historically speaking, low survivability of cancer has been caused due to lack of routine screening protocols (with survival rates as low as 25% between 1940-1960). Currently, the rate of survivability for breast cancer is approximately 99% for stage 1 breast cancer (meaning that early diagnosis increases survivability substantially). For these reasons, together with the fact that radiologist demand has increased in succession with the survivability, a machine learning model is being developed as part of the capstone project to not only lighten radiologist workload, but to also assist in early cancer diagnosis.

There are currently companies, such as google, working in conjunction with hospitals and medical institutions to develop novel machine learning models to detect malignant tumors within images. The growing demand for radiologists and image-based tests has created gap where there are not enough radiologists to examine the images properly (with the average radiologist having to diagnose an image every three to four seconds). The result is a great advance towards the use of machine learning algorithms and architectures developed by companies (such as google's Inception V3 neural network) and trained by medical institutions to assist in the early diagnosis of cancer. The capstone project also aims to assist in the early diagnosis of cancerous tumors.

The goal of the capstone project is to build a modular machine learning algorithms that uses high level risk factors in conjunction with a medical image of the region of interest to diagnose the malignancy of the tumor. Using high risk factors, such as weight, height, sex at birth, ethnicity, and many other patient data fields will allow to increase the correlation between the features extracted from the image and the diagnosis. This algorithm aims to input both an image and patient data together, have the features from the image extracted, condensed and concatenated to the features extracted from the Data fields and a set of fully connected layers finally diagnoses the patient data. This model aims to increase its accuracy while minimizing the required training time all the while providing medical institutions with a prebuilt data pipeline for both training and testing the machine learning model created.
