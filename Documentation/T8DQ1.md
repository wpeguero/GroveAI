# Topic 8 Discussion Question 1

As you are preparing for graduation, reflect on the possibility of publishing or presenting your current and future work. One first step toward this goal is to identify venues for publishing and presenting. Do the following:

1. Peruse opportunities on call-for-papers websites like the "Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Publications - Calls for Papers," located in the topic resources.
2. Identify three possible journals and three possible conferences for which it would be appropriate for you to submit a proposal. For each journal, briefly state in 1-2 sentences why your capstone project would be a good fit. Identify the specific areas and sessions as listed on the journal/conference website.
3. For one of the journals or conferences identified above, prepare a complete proposal and abstract, following the guidelines on the website, that you could submit if you decided to.
4. In yourr response to this DQ,  include the proposal (typically, answers to a few questions) and abstract (typically about 300-500 words). You do not have to submit the proposal to the journal/conference.

Comment on two other posts in class and provide feedback on the content, format, and adequacy of their would be submissions.

## Response

1st paper: [PLOS ONE - Early Detection, Screening, and Diagnosis of Cancer](https://collections.plos.org/call-for-papers/early-detection-screening-and-diagnosis-of-cancer/)
- My capstone project is focused on the early diagnosis of cancer, which fits the overall theme of the call-for-papers. My capstone project also uses collected medical data to assist in the developement of a machine learning model that can diagnose cancer using an image.

2nd paper: [The Lancet](https://www.thelancet.com/lancet/about?dgcid=hubspot_landing-page_lancetgrouponcology22&hsCtaTracking=fcaee0aa-219e-4b22-af31-eb0c6fa894c7%7C91978063-5c1a-406c-96a6-2d785a928cd9)

- The Lancet focuses on publishing cancer-related content, which matches the theme of my capstone project. The focus of the Lancet Journal is to publish academic articles that improve clinical practices (my capstone project currently aims to improve the field of radiology by lessening the workload of radiologists) and bring to attention the need for improved cancer health services.

3rd paper: [Biomedcentral](https://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/aicancerdiagnosis)

- This journal focuses on exploring new and innovative technologies in relation to cancer which my capstone project focuses on. The capstone project aims to demonstrate that current AI algorithms can be used to lighten the workload of radiologists.

1st conference: [Mind the Gap: Trailblazing Cancer Prevention](https://www.eacr.org/conference/cancerprevention2023?utm_source=hub&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=vMTG23)

- This conference aims to focus on preventative care of cancer. Part of cancer prevention is early diagnosis, which my capstone project focuses upon as it aims to assist radiologists at detecting malignant tumors in the earlier stages of cancer.

2nd conference: [AICR Research Conference](https://www.aicr.org/research/aicr-research-conference/)

3rd conference: [Cancer Research Conference](https://cancerresearchconference.org/)
