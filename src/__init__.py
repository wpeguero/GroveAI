"""Pyblight - A Helpful library for Healthcare-based ML.

The pyblight package contains a series of functions and classes to
process, analyze, and train health-based machine learning models. It
provides classes for training machine learning models on the pytorch
machine learning framework as well as functions that extract paths
from image folders (with custom datasets that handle DICOM data), and
functions that extracts and processes data from csv files.
